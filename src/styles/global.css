@import "tailwindcss";

/*
  All custom CSS properties and most global styles have been removed.
  Styling will be primarily handled by Tailwind CSS utility classes
  applied directly in components or Layout.astro.

  The body background, text color, and font-family will be set in Layout.astro
  or through Tailwind's default base styles.
  The DynaPuff font import and application is handled in Layout.astro.
  Sticky footer is managed via flex utilities in Layout.astro.
*/

/* Minimal global styles can remain if absolutely necessary, but prefer Tailwind. */
/* For example, if there's a very specific global reset or adjustment needed
   that Tailwind's preflight doesn't cover or that you want to override. */
